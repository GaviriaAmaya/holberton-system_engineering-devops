# 0x0A Configuration management

## Work log.

##### - Puppet
> Puppet is an automation tool that allows you to do some repetitive commands and other boring stuff. This is useful from starting configuration of your terminal (If you use a new device) to monitorize and maintain servers and bigger works

##### - Puppet lint
> Styling for puppet. But, more than that, Puppet lint also fix automatically the indentation and other styles, to be readable and easier to manage. A great example of how Puppet works. (Maybe it can do something with my Python style... Or, even Betty!)
