`compile` && `./[name]`

##### - Framework
Follow the framework and RTFM

##### - Line wrapping commands
Continue the commands and string literals with many options. From double quotes to backslash\
See [6-size.c](https://github.com/GaviriaAmaya/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x00-hello_world/6-size.c "6-size.c") and [How do I write a multi-line string literal in C?](https://jameshfisher.com/2016/11/30/c-multiline-literal/ "How do I write a multi-line string literal in C?")
