# 0x0B. SSH

## Learning Objectives.

#### - What is a server

#### - Where servers usually live

#### - What is SSH

#### - How to create an SSH RSA key pair

#### - How to connect to a remote host using an SSH RSA key pair

#### - The advantage of using #!/usr/bin/env bash instead of /bin/bash

## Work log.

##### - Puppet
> Puppet is an automation tool that allows you to do some repetitive commands and other boring stuff. This is useful from starting configuration of your terminal (If you use a new device) to monitorize and maintain servers and bigger works

##### - Puppet lint
> Styling for puppet. But, more than that, Puppet lint also fix automatically the indentation and other styles, to be readable and easier to manage. A great example of how Puppet works. (Maybe it can do something with my Python style... Or, even Betty!)
